Famigo AROMA GApps
=======
What is it?
------
A full featured GApps package that you can select what apps you want to install using AROMA. You can also remove some system apps that come preinstalled with your ROM.

What isn't it?
------
A slimmed down GApps (unless you install the Slim version). While you can slim down your ROM by not installing all the GApps or removing extra bloat with the Removal Tool, you will have a bigger download up front.

Slim Version
------
The Slim version has all the removal functionality that the normal one has; but it only includes Google Now, Google Home, and the Core Apps.

Google Apps
------------
Our GApps includes most of the Google Apps that come standard on Google Nexus devices. In this package you will find the Core Apps¹, Face Unlock², and the following Selectable applications:

¹ Core Apps includes the core system base apps as well as Google Play services and the Google Play Store.

² Face Unlock is installed on devices with a front camera.

How to Install
------------
1. Download a 4.3 or 4.4 ROM.
2. Download our GApps.
3. Reboot into your custom recovery.
  * I recommend TWRP if possible.
4. OPTIONAL (but recommended): Wipe system, cache, and dalvik cache before installing ROM.
  * This will not erase your Files.
5. Flash ROM of choice
6. Flash our GApps that you downloaded earlier.
7. Finally, follow the on-screen instructions to install your GApps!

Backup and Restore
------------
Our GApps has the ability to backup your selections and restore them for later use.
