Famigo AROMA GApps
============
What it is?
------------
A full featured GApps package that you can select what apps you want to install. You can also remove some system apps that come preinstalled with your ROM.

What it isn't?
------------
A slimmed down GApps. While you can slim down your ROM by not installing all the GApps or removing extra bloat with the Removal Tool, you will have a bigger download up front.

Google Apps
------------
Our GApps includes most of the Google Apps that come standard on Google Nexus devices.
In this package you will find the Core Apps¹, Face Unlock², and the following Selectable applications:

|Plus|Drive|Play|Search|Other|

How to Install
------------
1. Download a 4.3 or 4.4 ROM.
2. Download our GApps.
3. Reboot into your custom recovery.
  * I recommend TWRP if possible.
4. OPTIONAL (but recommended): Wipe system, cache, and dalvik cache before installing ROM.
  * This will not erase your Files.
5. Flash ROM of choice
6. Flash our GApps that you downloaded earlier.
7. Finally, follow the on-screen instructions to install your GApps!

Backup and Restore
------------
Our GApps has the ability to backup your selections and restore them for later use.
If the changelog says to "Make a new Backup" then make sure you do it!
