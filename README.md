How to Install
------------
1. Download a 4.3 or 4.4 ROM.
2. Download our GApps.
3. Reboot into your custom recovery.
  * I recommend TWRP if possible.
4. OPTIONAL (but recommended): Wipe system, cache, and dalvik cache before installing ROM.
  * This will not erase your Files.
5. Flash ROM of choice
6. Flash our GApps that you downloaded earlier.
7. Finally, follow the on-screen instructions to install your GApps!

Backup and Restore
------------
Our GApps has the ability to backup your selections and restore them for later use.
If the changelog says to "Make a new Backup" then make sure you do it!
