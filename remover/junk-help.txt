# Famigo AROMA GApps Remover How-To

# QUICK HOW-TO
# Everything after a pound sign/hashtag/"#" is removed from the script
# That is, all the tutorials, app descriptions, and apps you want to keep
# Thus, only leaving the script with the files you want to remove
# Edit the list below as you see fit, examples:
#      AdobeReader.apk  > Removed (because there is no "#")
#      #AdobeReader.apk > NOT Removed (because of "#")
#      AdobeReader.apk #PDF Reader > Removed (but extra text ignored)

# ADDING YOUR OWN FILES
# By saving this file to /sdcard/Famigo/junk.txt you can add files.
# Files can be added from anywhere and even using wildcards.
# Files and folders deleted ARE case-sensitive, examples:
# /path/to/file/file.txt > Deletes file.txt
# /path/to/folder/       > Deletes folder ... REMEMBER the trailing "/"
# /system/app/Apollo.apk > Deletes the system app Apollo ... REMEMBER to Scan Everywhere during install when including FULL PATH
# /data/app/Facebook.apk > Deletes the user app Facebook (if that's what it is named) ... REMEMBER to Scan Everywhere during install when including FULL PATH
# Apollo.apk             > Deletes the app Apollo ... REMEMBER to Scan System/App and/or Data/App depending on location
# Facebook.apk           > Deletes the app Facebook ... REMEMBER to Scan System/App and/or Data/App depending on location
# Apollo                 > Deletes apps named Apollo ... REMEMBER to Scan System/App and/or Data/App depending on location
# Facebook               > Deletes apps named Facebook ... REMEMBER to Scan System/app and/or Data/App depending on location
# Apo*                   > Deletes all files starting with "Apo" ... Be CAREFUL with wildcards. Safe examples can be seen in script

# WHAT TO SCAN
# During installation (ie removal), you will be asked which folders to scan
# By default, Nightly Updater will only Scan System/App which is where system apps -
# and PARTICULARLY junk apps are located. However, you may want to erase user apps 
# that are located in Data/App or other system files located elsewhere.
# Unless you are specifically trying to remove user installed apps - do not check Scan Data/App ... files below with [D] are located in /data/app
# Unless you are trying to delete a specific file or folder (ringtones, wallpapers, etc) - do not check Scan Everywhere

# GOOD LUCK
